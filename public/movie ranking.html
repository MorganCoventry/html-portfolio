 <h1>Morgan's Favorite Movies!</h1>
 <h2>These are my personal top 3 favorite movies / franchises.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Deadpool 1, 2 & 3</h3>
 <p>These movies portray a sense of humour like no other. They don't hold back when it comes to action, voilence, witty jokes and dark humour.</p>
 <h3>Harry Potter Franchise</h3>
 <p>Growing up in the eary 2000's "Harry Potter" was an integral part of my childhood. The pure wonder portrayed in these movies are encapturing.</p>
 <h3>Back To the Future 1, 2 & 3</h3>
 <p>These movies are timeless (excuse the pun). Everything from the sets, the styles and the music bring you back (or forwards) in time to wherever or whenever Marty Mcfly and Doc Emmit Brown find themselves.</p>
